# Instructions
For HW2, we walked through some of the essential features of Git and GitHub. We began by setting up our accounts, ensuring we had the proper downloads, and generated an SSH key if we didn't have one already. Once completed, we jumped in by creating our own repo on GitHub before cloning it to our own machine for local use. We went over the general work flow of checking things with status, using add/rm, and committing before syncing these changes up with the remote repo on GitHub. We applied this similar work flow in a new dimension by tackling branches, a way to work on features separate from other instances of your code, and how to reintegrate said branches with merge. We then explored forking repos and the workflow associated with that (e.g. cloning and adding upstream to remote) before introducing the concept of pull requests: how to create them and sync your local repository to the upstream repository.
